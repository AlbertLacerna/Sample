	    <th><p><h3>He is also known as Ibarra's father. He was kind and loving person who was also very wealthy and a lot people pay respect to him. However he is also a good example of an innocent man in prison all because he wanted to help kid who got hit by the head by artelyero. He was falsy accused to killing that man even though he didn't. Even though doctor who did atutopsy said it wasn't him who killed lot of people started to blame for everything even a powerful person kapitan heneral started to accused him of something all because he didn't like his beliefs and people who are jealous tried blamming him for anything showingthe biased of spanish people to us in the justice system. </h3></p></th></tr>

	    <th><p><h3>Known as a friend of Kapitan Tiago is a person who you thought at first is a kind person but treated people diffrent as she sees her self as a Kastila and the Filippinos as a lower class citizen who is beneath her and the kastilas being better. But how ironic she was because she is a Filippino herself and was willing to change anything about herself just to fit in on what she thought was better even though ironically she just made herself look desperate then a better person. </h3></p></th></tr>

	    <th><p><h3>He wasn't really in the story but did help us know why did he stoped writing because if you read chapter two you would see a line where he goes he dosen't write anymore because if he writes anything bad about the spanish he might go to jail all because the spanish wanted to censor it. So he stoped because he didn't want to write fake news showing us that he cared about writing but thanks to the spanish he stoped because he wanted to write something real and was willing show integrity. </h3></p></th></tr>
